# SysAdminToolbox

A bunch of simple powershell tools to make Sysadmins' everyday work easier

## Install

This module is not yet pushed to PSGallery. In order to use it, download or clone it. Afterwards, open a powershell session, navigate to the folder and run

````powershell
Import-Module .\SysAdminToolbox.psd1
````

In case you want to import a newer version of the toolbox while an older has been imported already, use the parameter `-Force`.

## Roadmap

No precise roadmap, I'm adding stuff whenever I find something useful. Documenting will be a focus. Any help is appreciated.
